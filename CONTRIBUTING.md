# Contributions guide for Varia

If you have any questions you can always reach me via email (giantpinkrobots@protonmail.com) or through Matrix (@giantpinkrobots:matrix.org). Thanks! :)

## Code

If you want to contribute code, you mainly want the 'next' branch for things like new features that'll land in the next major version, as that branch is for active development. For very important bug fixes however, you want the 'main' branch, so I can release a hotfix quickly from there without having to also release all the untested new features in development. These fixes can be applied to the 'next' branch later.

## Translations

There is now a Weblate instance for Varia, kindly provided by Weblate for free (thanks Weblate! <3). As such, the hosted Weblate instance will be used for translations from now on. It makes following through with Varia's development much easier if you're a translator. There's no need to open pull requests for each time you want to push forward an addition or change.

The Weblate instance is for the 'next' branch, which is the development branch of Varia. However, if there is a really embarassing mistake that needs immediate correction with a hotfix, you should do a pull request for the 'main' branch here. **Please don't do this for corrections or additions that aren't super important though.**
